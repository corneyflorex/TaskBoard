So basically anyone can create an AnonTask, spammers kept out with captcha

The task starts at the top of the RECENT TASK board, and slowly moves down as other tasks generate participants or new tasks are posted

If a task gets a participant, it moves to the top of the RECENT TASKS board, if tthe task gets no participants it moves down and down the page until it dies off after 24 hours if it doesnt become "Active".

A task becomes "Active" when it generates over 100 participants in a single day. And moves from the RECENT TASK's into active tasks until it doesn't generate enough participants per day - it then drops back to recent tasks.
